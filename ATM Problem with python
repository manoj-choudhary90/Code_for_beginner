"""Question:
Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM.
The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5,
and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction
(including bank charges).
For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.
Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.
"""
# Solution

amt, bal = input("Enter the amount you want to withdraw and your account balance : ").split()
amt, bal = float(amt), float(bal)

if amt % 5 == 0 and (amt + 0.5) <= bal:
    bal -= (amt + 0.5)
    print(f"You debited : {amt} and Your balance : {bal}")
        
else:
    print(f"You balance : {bal}")
