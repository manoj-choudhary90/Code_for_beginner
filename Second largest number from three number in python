""" Question : Three numbers A, B and C are the inputs. Write a program to find second largest among them.
Input : The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three integers A, B and C.
Output : For each test case, display the second largest among A, B and C, in a new line.

Example:
Sample Input:
3 
41 20 300
21312 221 70
31 4 777

Sample Output:
41
221
31
