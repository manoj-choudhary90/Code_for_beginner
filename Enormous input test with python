""" Question
The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning.
You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.
"""
Solution
n, k = map(int, input().split())
n, k = int(n), int(k)
count = 0
    
for i in range(n):
    value = int(input())
    if value % k == 0:
        count += 1
print(count)
